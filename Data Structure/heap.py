- A heap is a tree-like structure.
Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for all k,
counting elements from 0.
- A heap is NOT a sorted structure and can be regarded as partially ordered

min heap: the smallest key is always at the front
max heap: the largest key is always at the front

# A priority queue is common implemented with a heap

# Stack, Queue and Priority queue are abstract data type,
# but Heap is a specific data structure.
