1. Even Tree
Given a tree (simple graph with no cycles), remove as many edges form the tree as
possible to obtain a forest while: Each connected component of the forest should
contain an even number of vertices. Find out the number of removed edges
--
input format:
    two integers means two vertices, and a edge betweens them
Forest:
    A forest is an undirected graph, all of whose connected components are trees; in other words, the graph consists of a disjoint union of trees. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected cycle-free graph. As special cases, an empty graph, a single tree, and the discrete graph on a set of vertices (that is, the graph with these vertices that has no edges), all are examples of forests.
