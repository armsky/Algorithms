1. P: is set of problems that can be solved by determinitisic Turing machine in Polynomial time

2. NP: is set of decision problems that can be solved by non-deterministic Turing Machine in Polinominal time.

P is subset of NP.

3. NP-complete problems are the hardest problem in NP set, a decision problem L is NP-complete if:
    a. L is in NP (a solution can be verified but not efficient)
    b. Every problem in NP is reducible to L in in polynomial time

4. NP-hard if it follows property (b) but not follow property (a)
So NP-complete set is also a subset of NP-Hard set.
