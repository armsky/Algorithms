"""
Syllabus
1) Dynamic Programming
2) Super recursion (permutation, combination,...2^n, m^n, n!...etc. type of program. (NP hard, NP programs)
3) Probability related programs
4) Graphs: BFS/DFS are usually enough
5) All basic data structures from Arrays/Lists to circular queues, BSTs, Hash tables, B-Trees, and Red-Black trees, and all basic algorithms like sorting, binary search, median,...
6) Problem solving ability at a level similar to TopCoder Division 1, 250 points. If you can consistently solve these, then you are almost sure to get in with 2-weeks brush up.
7) Review all old interview questions in Glassdoor to get a feel. If you can solve 95% of them at home (including coding them up quickly and testing them out in a debugger + editor setup), you are in good shape.
8) Practice coding--write often and write a lot. If you can think of a solution, you should be able to code it easily...without much thought.
9) Very good to have for design interview: distributed systems knowledge and practical experience.
10) Good understanding of basic discrete math, computer architecture, basic math.
11) Coursera courses and assignments give a lot of what you need to know.
12) Note that all the above except the first 2 are useful in "real life" programming too!

# Graphs
"""
Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth‐first search and depth‐first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*

# Advice
"""
And then start doing practice problems. You want this stuff to be intuitive so that you don't have to think about how to implement BFS. Implementing these more advanced algorithms is a good starting place, but don't let it be your sole source of preparation. I strongly recommend looking at Glassdoor and CareerCup and Interview Cake for more examples of actual questions that get asked. Cracking the Coding Interview is of course a great reference as well.

Dynamic programming is another thing you should practice. Yeah, you probably know it. You get it. But can you do it on the spot on a whiteboard for a problem you've never seen before without making mistakes? You need to get to that point, or at least reasonably close to it. The only way to do that is to just practice. Understanding is only half the equation. Speed is the other half.

Finally, keep in mind that probably at least one of your 6+ interviewers will ask you about operating systems or system design. In my opinion, those are the hardest questions by far to prepare for because there's just no "study list" for it. Interviewers can ask basically whatever they want, so you might even get a guy who wants you to just write huge regular expressions, or mess around with bit fiddling for 45 minutes. The unpredictability of it all certainly sucks, but my advice is to be prepared not just for the core data structures and algorithms but also off-the-beaten-path topics like those I just mentioned.
